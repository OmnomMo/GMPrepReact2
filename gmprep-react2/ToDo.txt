BUGS:
- Setting map icon size does nothing / will be reset
- FIXED Updating a node will destroy all map node entries T_T
- Resizing the window will fuck up map node placement
- FIXED Editing a listentry (for example an action) sometimes adds it to the EditableList entries a second time under the index "undefined"
- FIXED Skills do not store their value in the database when being udpated / submitted
- FIXED Deleting ListItems in a nodeentry and updating it on the database does not work correctly
- FIXED new secrets say "undefined"
- FIXED should switch currentNOde to new node after adding it
- FIXED should switch back to default node when pressing cancel or plus icon


Polish:
- Warning when discarding unsaved changes
- Maybe we need less requests. can the post request for updating/deleting nodes and mapnodes already return all map nodes?
	- And can we use that data without invalidating previous queries?
- Show placeholder / loading symbol after node is dropped on map until server answer
